Each probe functions as a hands-on experiment, allowing citizens to directly engage with and understand how AI systems can impact our civic autonomy. From exploring algorithmic bias to examining data ownership, these probes reveal the often invisible ways AI shapes our digital landscape. By making these concepts tangible and explorable, the archive empowers visitors to think critically about AI's role in our society and the importance of protecting our collective digital rights."
