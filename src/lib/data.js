In the early 1980s my grandparents moved here (my grandfather was a furniture maker in Oxford, owning a small studio called Crowdys, and in his retirement brought his workshop to the village). The workshop became a space for learning about traditional crafts such as woodturning on lathes, and also a space for sharing language and stories. In the village, which is also home to an unusually large number of palaeontologists, being located near a famous fossil discovery site, there is now an unusually large number of residents who are skilled on the lathe. The workshop still exists 40 years later and most summers I return to continue the trend of creating, teaching and learning. The community which exists around this one workshop is multi-generational and multilingual - both important parts of how I think about my design practice."

          content: "â€œHow urban spaces are experienced can be seen as determined by the competing ideological standpoints of architects, developers and social activists. Despots like Robert Moses and Le Corbusier represent a â€˜top-downâ€™ approach towards city planning, where the â€˜surgical removalâ€™ of diverse neighborhoods and their replacement with â€˜modern slabsâ€™, are seen as the most efficient way of ensuring progress and improvement in a city. In opposition to this â€˜homogenizing clarityâ€™, stands the model of â€˜bottom-upâ€™ regeneration, advocated by Jane Jacobs, who insists the city is a complex â€˜ecosystemâ€™ in which urban spaces are gradually improved through community investment and non-centralized planning (Tyrnauer). The experience of urban life, this essay intends to argue, is normally defined by the equilibrium created by these competing ideological positions; but recently, the development of new technology and the increasing influence of digitization, has favored the â€˜top-downâ€™ model of city planning."
